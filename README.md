iOS Core ML Wine Quality Predictor

Hi. This application is rough. I just wanted to demonstrate another application of Core ML using two data sets to predict the quality of wine. Please only use "red" or "white" in the wine type and only use numerical values for the predicted values since I have no text validation in the application. This application uses the UCI Wine Quality data set, and Apple's Core ML framework. Also, I don't think the predictions are that great. scikit-Learn says it's like a 30% fit so don't expect any great results.
If you are interested in learning more, let me know.
